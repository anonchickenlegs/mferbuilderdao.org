order: 4

## Ideas are everything. Ideas are the product of humans being creative. Some ideas even have the potential to turn into _dope shit_.

The mferbuilderDAO turns **ideas** into **dope shit** via **onchain proposals**.

In order to maximize the chance of creating dope shit, proposals should go these following stages:

1. the **chaos** of [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pteFhXpCrw) and Twitter (idea factory)
2. an **offchain** proposal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mferbuilderdao.eth) (heat check)
3. an **onchain** proposal to the [DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/0x795D300855069F602862c5e23814Bdeeb25DCa6b) (the real deal)

The DAO is still very new, and we are currently discussing and optimizing our workflow! More thorough processes will be published when they are identified and put into practice. Pop into the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pteFhXpCrw) and see what the builders are hacking on!
